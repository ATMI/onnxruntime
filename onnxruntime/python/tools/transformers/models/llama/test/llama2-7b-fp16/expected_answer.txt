The answer to this question is that hydrogen is the lightest element. Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1 and a mass number of 1, which means it only contains one proton in its nucleus. This makes it much lighter than other elements with higher atomic numbers or mass numbers.
Hydrogen also has a very low density compared to other elements due to its small size and low atomic weight (one-twelfth that of carbon). As such, it can be found in many different forms including gas, liquid, solid crystals and even plasma formations within stars like our sun!
What Is The Lightest Element In The Periodic Table?
The lightest element in the periodic table is helium. Helium is a noble gas and has two electrons in its outer shell, making it unreactive with most substances. It’s also extremely rare on Earth because it’s so lightweight – just one atom weighs less than four hydrogen atoms combined!
Helium was first discovered by Sir William Ramsay and Lord Rayleigh in 1895 when they isolated samples from air using liquefaction techniques at low temperatures (-269°C).
